# Spotify 2023 Music Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify's music data from 2023. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into music trends, artist performance, platform presence, and audio feature characteristics, all presented in a visually engaging Spotify dark mode theme.

The dashboard is designed across two main pages:
1.  **Spotify 2023 Overview & Trends:** Provides high-level KPIs, total stream trends over time, Spotify playlist inclusion trends, and a dynamic view of the top 10 most streamed songs.
2.  **Deep Dive Analysis:** Offers detailed insights into top artists, comparison of chart appearances across different music platforms (Apple, Deezer, Shazam, Spotify), and average audio features (e.g., Danceability, Energy, Valence).

## Features

* **Interactive Design:** Utilizes Power BI's interactive capabilities with slicers for dynamic filtering by release year, artist, and music mode (Major/Minor).
* **Spotify Dark Mode Theme:** A custom-designed dark theme with Spotify green (`#1DB954`) and cornflower blue (`#6495ED`) accents, inspired by Spotify's user interface, ensuring an immersive and visually appealing experience.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displays crucial metrics such as Total Streams, Total Tracks, and Total Artists.
* **Trend Analysis:** Visualizes stream volume and playlist inclusion trends over time to identify growth patterns and shifts.
* **Top Lists:** Showcases the top 10 most streamed songs (using an engaging horizontal bar chart with alternating colors) and top artists by streams.
* **Platform Comparison:** Breaks down song presence across major music charting platforms.
* **Audio Feature Analysis:** Explores the average characteristics of music, providing insights into various audio features like Danceability, Energy, and Valence.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.
* **Power Query:** Used for data cleaning and transformation processes.
